## 📌 Objective
The objective of this project is to build an application that generates secure passwords for users.  
Passwords can be:

- Completely random
- Based on user interests or keywords
- Generated under specific rules (such as PINs or word-based passwords)

The goal is to provide flexibility while maintaining strong security practices.

---

## 🔐 Features (Planned & In Progress)
The application aims to support multiple types of password generation, including:

- Random alphanumeric passwords
- Word-based passwords
- PIN-style numeric passwords
- Passwords following custom user-defined rules
- Interest-based password generation (user-provided keywords)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies (Planned)
*(Update this section as your stack becomes finalized)*

- Programming Language: Java
- UI Framework: JavaFX
- Storage (if needed): TBD

---

## 🚀 How the Application Will Work
1. The user selects the type of password they want to generate
2. The user optionally provides preferences such as:
    - Length
    - Allowed characters
    - Keywords or interests
3. The application generates and displays a password
4. The user can regenerate or copy the password
